## Bundlers

Bundlers are tools that help us convert modules with dependencies into static assets (HTML, CSS, and JS).

> - Bundlers help because browser capabilities are limited.  
> - Examples of bundlers include:  
>   - **Browserify**  
>   - **Grunt** 
>   - **Parcel** 
>   - **Vite** - For this course we will be focusing on Vite
>   - **Webpack** â€“ This was the first major innovation in the bundler space.  
>   - One major challenge with Webpack is that it's complex â€” however, it's also very flexible.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a feature supported by Webpack that delays loading of modules until they're needed. It helps improve performance by reducing the initial load size. Lazy-loaded modules are also cached by default.

> - Lazy loading is different from conditional rendering.  
> - It works best when focusing on specific routes or pages.  
> - It also enables **dynamic import**, where modules are loaded like functions.

## How to Use Vite
> 1. Create your folder using using mkdir "folder name"
> 2. Create a package.json
> - npm init -y
> 3. Install vite as a dev dependency
> - npm i --save -dev vite
> 4. Create the files
> - touch index.[html,css,js]
> 5. Setup gitignore
Setup *Build Script*
> - inside the html file do 
> - html: 5 this will create a boilerplate
> 7. Test: To start using vite set up **dev script**

---

```
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

> 8. Then in the terminal run
> - then **npm run dev** and click on the link of the local host
** When using vite you no longer need **live server**
To host on services like netlify
> - **do npm run build**
> Then **vite preview** - This is the example of what the code will loke like in production
**pnpm uses add while npm uses install**
